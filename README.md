- **Background Tasks:** `workmanager` for running background processes like the missed dose check on mobile platforms.
- **Audio Recording & Playback:** `record` for voice note recording and `just_audio` for playback.
- **Text-to-Speech:** `flutter_tts` for potential future voice-based features.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Platform Differences

This application is primarily designed for mobile use (Android/iOS). While the web version is functional for scheduling and displaying data, certain key features are not available due to browser limitations:

- **Background Tasks:** The `workmanager` plugin is not supported on the web, meaning the "missed dose check" and caregiver alerts will **not** work.
- **Notifications:** Web notifications can only be displayed when the browser tab is open. They will not be delivered if the browser is closed.
- **Local Storage:** The voice notes are stored as local files on mobile devices, but on the web, they are handled as temporary URLs (blobs).
